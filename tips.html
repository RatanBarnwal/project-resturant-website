                <h2>Meals on higher fibre starchy carbohydrates</h2>
                <p>Starchy carbohydrates should make up just over a third of the food you eat. They include potatoes,
                    bread, rice, pasta and cereals. Choose higher fibre or wholegrain varieties, such as wholewheat
                    pasta, brown rice or potatoes with their skins on.</p>

                <h2>Do not get thirsty</h2>
                <p>You need to drink plenty of fluids to stop you getting dehydrated. The government recommends drinking
                    6 to 8 glasses every day. This is in addition to the fluid you get from the food you eat.
                    Remember to drink more fluids during hot weather or while exercising.

                <h2>Do not skip breakfast</h2>
                <p>Some people skip breakfast because they think it'll help them lose weight.
                    But a healthy breakfast high in fibre and low in fat, sugar and salt can form part of a balanced
                    diet, and can help you get the nutrients you need for good health.
